## Introduction to the topic

Unsupervised learning is a type of self-organized Hebbian learning that helps find previously unknown patterns in data set without pre-existing labels. It is also known as self-organization and allows modeling probability densities of given inputs. It is one of the main three categories of machine learning, along with supervised and reinforcement learning.

## Pros and cons

### Pros:
- Less complexity in comparison with supervised learning. Unlike in supervised algorithms, in unsupervised learning, no one is required to understand and then to label the data inputs. This makes unsupervised learning less complex and explains why many people prefer unsupervised techniques.
- Takes place in real time such that all the input data to be analyzed and labeled in the presence of learners. This helps them to understand very well different models of learning and sorting of raw data.
- It is often easier to get unlabeled data â€” from a computer than labeled data, which need person intervention. This is also a key difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.

### Cons:
- You cannot get very specific about the definition of the data sorting and the output. This is because the data used in unsupervised learning is labeled and not known. It is a job of the machine to label and group the raw data before determining the hidden patterns.
- Less accuracy of the results. This is also because the input data is not known and not labeled by people in advance, which means that the machine will need to do this alone.
- The results of the analysis cannot be ascertained. There is no prior knowledge in the unsupervised method of machine learning. Additionally, the numbers of classes are also not known. It leads to the inability to ascertain the results generated by the analysis.
